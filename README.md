# PsychRewrittenWiki
This is a fanmade rewrite of the official Psych Engine wiki.

This used to be a fork of Psych Engine, however it's now it's own repository.

Since ShadowMario hasn't updated the official wiki in months, we (Baldi and Yang) decided to rewrite it.

For problems and/or suggestions, you can make an issue on this repository, or DM us on Discord at Detective Baldi#1002 or Murderous Yang#1493.

This wiki's content is mostly stuff related to Psych Engine's Lua system, for learning things like how to use the in-engine editors, look at the official Psych Engine wiki.

Please note that some variables and/or functions on this wiki haven't been implemented in the official releases of Psych Engine. Some of these features can only be accessed via Psych Engine's action builds until the next official release.

You can get Psych Engine on the Github page [here](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine), or the Gamebanana page [here](https://gamebanana.com/mods/309789).
